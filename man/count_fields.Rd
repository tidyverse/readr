\title{Count the number of fields in each line of a file.}
\usage{
count_fields(file, tokenizer, skip = 0, n_max = -1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data
   (either a single string or a raw vector).

   Files ending in \code{.gz}, \code{.bz2}, \code{.xz}, or \code{.zip} will
   be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with \code{http://},
   \code{https://}, \code{ftp://}, or \code{ftps://} will be automatically
   downloaded. Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded &
   decompressed.

   Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. It must contain at
   least one new line to be recognised as data (instead of a path).}

\item{tokenizer}{A tokenizer that specifies how to break the \code{file}
up into fields, e.g., \code{\link{tokenizer_csv}},
\code{\link{tokenizer_fwf}}}

\item{skip}{Number of lines to skip before reading data.}

\item{n_max}{Optionally, maximum number of rows to count fields for.}
}
\description{
This is useful for diagnosing problems with functions that fail
to parse correctly.

\examples{
count_fields(system.file("extdata/mtcars.csv", package = "readr"),
 tokenizer_csv())
}
