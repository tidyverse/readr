## Overview

The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data from delimited files, such as comma-separated values (CSV) and tab-separated values (TSV).
It is designed to parse many types of data found in the wild, while providing an informative problem report when parsing leads to unexpected results.
If you are new to readr, the best place to start is the [data import chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) in R for Data Science.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get readr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just readr:
install.packages("readr")
```

::: .pkgdown-devel
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/readr")
```

## Usage

readr is part of the core tidyverse, so load it with:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

To accurately read a rectangular dataset with readr you combine two pieces: a function that parses the overall file, and a column specification.
The column specification describes how each column should be converted from a character vector to the most appropriate data type.

If column specification is not provided, readr will guess column types.
As always, remember that the best strategy is to provide explicit column types as any data analysis project matures past the exploratory phase.

`vignette("column-types")` gives more detail on how readr guesses the column types.

readr supports the following file formats with these `read_` functions:

* `read_csv()`: comma separated (csv) files
* `read_tsv()`: tab separated (tsv) files
* `read_delim()`: general delimited files
* `read_fwf()`: fixed width files (fwf)
* `read_table()`: tabular files where columns are separated by white-space.
* `read_log()`: web log files

The following example loads a sample file bundled with readr:

```{r}
mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
```

Note that readr prints the column types.
This is useful because it allows you to check that the columns have been read in as you expect.
If they haven't, you can use `spec()` to retrieve the column specification and then copy and paste into a new call with the desired column types:

```{r}
spec(mtcars)

mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"), col_types = 
  list(
    mpg = col_double(),
    cyl = col_integer(),
    disp = col_double(),
    hp = col_integer(),
    drat = col_double(),
    vs = col_integer(),
    wt = col_double(),
    qsec = col_double(),
    am = col_integer(),
    gear = col_integer(),
    carb = col_integer()
  )
)
```

`vignette("readr")` gives more detail on how readr parses data.

## Editions

readr got a new parsing engine in version 2.0.0 (released July 2021).
In this so-called second edition, readr calls `vroom::vroom()`, by default.
This means, when you call readr you are in effect calling `vroom::vroom()`.

The parsing engine in readr versions prior to 2.0.0 is now called the first edition.
If youâ€™re using readr >= 2.0.0, you can still access first edition parsing via the functions `with_edition(1, ...)` and `local_edition(1)`.
And, obviously, if you're using readr < 2.0.0, you will get first edition parsing, by definition, because that's all there is.

New code and actively-maintained code should use the 2nd edition.
The workarounds `with_edition(1, ...)` and `local_edition(1)` are offered as a pragmatic way to patch up legacy code or as a temporary solution for infelicities identified as the 2nd edition matures.

## Alternatives

There are two main alternatives to readr: base R and data.table's `fread()`.
The most important differences are discussed below.

### Base R

Compared to the corresponding base functions, readr functions:

* Use a consistent naming scheme for the parameters (e.g. `col_names` and 
 `col_types` not `header` and `colClasses`).
 
* Are generally much faster (up to 10x-100x) faster depending on the dataset.

* Leave strings as is by default, and automatically parse common 
  date/time formats.

* Have a helpful progress bar if loading is going to take a while.

* All functions work exactly the same way regardless of the current locale.
  To override the US-centric defaults, use `locale()`.

### data.table and `fread()`

[data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) has a function similar to `read_csv()` called fread. Compared to fread, readr functions:

* Are sometimes slower, particularly on numeric heavy data.

* Forces you to supply all parameters, where `fread()` saves you work by
  automatically guessing the delimiter, whether or not the file has a
  header, and how many lines to skip.

  deterministic finite automata for parsing, and for teaching me why I 
  should write a tokenizer.
