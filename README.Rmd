## Overview

The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf).
It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes.
If you are new to readr, the best place to start is the [data import chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) in R for data science.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get readr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just readr:
install.packages("readr")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/readr")
```

## Usage

readr is part of the core tidyverse, so load it with:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

To accurately read a rectangular dataset with readr you combine two pieces: a function that parses the overall file, and a column specification.
The column specification describes how each column should be converted from a character vector to the most appropriate data type.
If column specification is not provided `readr` will try to guess column types but there are limitations and `readr` does not always get it right.
A better approach is to specify the column types.
`vignette("column-types")` gives more detail on how readr guesses the column types and how to most efficiently guess column types based on the version of `readr` you are using.

readr supports six file formats with six `read_` functions:

* `read_csv()`: comma separated (CSV) files
* `read_tsv()`: tab separated files
* `read_delim()`: general delimited files
* `read_fwf()`: fixed width files 
* `read_table()`: tabular files where columns are separated by white-space.
* `read_log()`: web log files

The following example loads a sample file bundled with readr:

```{r}
mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
```

Note that readr prints the column specification.
This is useful because it allows you to check that the columns have been read in as you expect, and if they haven't, you can use `spec()` to retrieve the column specifications then copy and paste into a new call with the desired column types:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
spec(mtcars)

mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"), col_types = 
  list(
    mpg = col_double(),
    cyl = col_integer(),
    disp = col_double(),
    hp = col_integer(),
    drat = col_double(),
    vs = col_integer(),
    wt = col_double(),
    qsec = col_double(),
    am = col_integer(),
    gear = col_integer(),
    carb = col_integer()
  )
)
```


## Alternatives

There are two main alternatives to readr: base R and data.table's `fread()`.
The most important differences are discussed below.

### Base R

Compared to the corresponding base functions, readr functions:

* Use a consistent naming scheme for the parameters (e.g. `col_names` and 
 `col_types` not `header` and `colClasses`).
 
* Are generally much faster (up to 10x-100x) faster depending on the dataset.

* Leave strings as is by default, and automatically parse common 
  date/time formats.

* Have a helpful progress bar if loading is going to take a while.

* All functions work exactly the same way regardless of the current locale.
  To override the US-centric defaults, use `locale()`.

### data.table and `fread()`

[data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) has a function similar to `read_csv()` called fread. Compared to fread, readr functions:

* Are sometimes slower, particularly on numeric heavy data.

* Forces you to supply all parameters, where `fread()` saves you work by
  automatically guessing the delimiter, whether or not the file has a
  header, and how many lines to skip.


## Editions

The version of `readr` discussed above (version >= 2.0.0) uses a different parsing engine than previous versions (< 2.0.0) and warrants some discussion.

readr got a new parsing engine in version 2.0.0 (released July 2021).
In this so-called second edition, readr calls `vroom::vroom()`, by default.
This means, when you call `readr` you are in effect calling `vroom::vroom()`.

The parsing engine in readr versions prior to 2.0.0 is now called the first edition.
If you're using readr >= 2.0.0, you can still access first edition parsing via the functions `with_edition()` and `local_edition()`.
And, obviously, if you're using readr < 2.0.0, you will get first edition parsing, by definition, because that's all there is.
